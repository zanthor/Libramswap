# LibramSwap
Swaps to the correct libram before casting Paladin spells. Just put them in your bag and cast!

Supports casts via the action bar, macros, the spellbook, and all addons I've seen so far (but make an issue if you find one that doesn't work).

## Commands
All commands support three aliases: `/libramswap`, `/lswap`, or `/ls`

### Basic Commands
- `/ls` - Toggle LibramSwap on/off
- `/ls on` - Enable LibramSwap
- `/ls off` - Disable LibramSwap
- `/ls spam` - Toggle swap confirmation messages
- `/ls status` - Show current settings
- `/ls help` - Show command list

### Libram Selection
Some spells have multiple libram options. You can choose which one to use:

#### Consecration
- `/ls consecration faithful` or `/ls c f` - Use **Libram of the Faithful** (default)
- `/ls consecration farraki` or `/ls c z` - Use **Libram of the Farraki Zealot**

#### Holy Strike
- `/ls holystrike eternal` or `/ls hs e` - Use **Libram of the Eternal Tower** (default)
- `/ls holystrike radiance` or `/ls hs r` - Use **Libram of Radiance**

### Note
`/ls` may conflict with LazyScript - if it does for you, use `/lswap` instead.
